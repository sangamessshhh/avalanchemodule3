I have created a token called Sangamesh and deployed it to Hardhat Network.

## Description

In this project, I have created a token using openzeppelin where you can mint, burn, approve, check the allowance & balance, transfer, transfer ownership and more..

I have deployed this contract that i created to the hardhat network. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., mod3.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract HelloWorld {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}

```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile mod3.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "mod3" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
